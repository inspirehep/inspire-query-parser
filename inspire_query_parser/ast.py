AbstractSyntaxTree classes along with their concrete ones.

The module defines a generic AST element along with four AST node categories (which act as a basis for all the concrete
AST nodes) and finally, the concrete classes which represent the output of the parsing process.

The generic AST node categories are:
    - Leaf
    - UnaryOp
    - BinaryOp
    - ListOp

The concrete AST nodes, represent higher level (domain specific) nodes.
